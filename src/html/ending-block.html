            <p class="ending-block__descr descr">“ErgoErgo is the most effective dynamic seating I’ve used with my
               students. All students would benefit from it.”</p>
            <p class="ending-block__descr descr">Kids learn better when they move. They play, touch, build, skip, wiggle
               and giggle.</p>
            <p class="ending-block__descr descr">More and more teachers are discovering that sitting on ErgoErgo not
               only makes students sit better, it also makes them more focused and attentive.</p>
            <p class="ending-block__descr descr">In a Maryland survey, 84% of educators and occupations therapists
               reported that sitting on ErgoErgo improved student behavior and that their students would benefit from
               using ErgoErgo daily.</p>
